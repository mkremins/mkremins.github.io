<p>Hi there! I’m <strong>Max Kreminski</strong>. I’m currently a PhD student in <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/departments/computational-media">Computational Media</a> at the <a href="https://games.soe.ucsc.edu/eis">Expressive Intelligence Studio</a> at <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz</a>. I frequently find myself <a href="https://mkremins.itch.io">designing games</a>; <a href="https://github.com/mkremins">programming computers</a>; <a href="/">writing words</a>; and conducting research on the subjects of human-computer interaction, creativity, and play.</p>
<p><strong>Affording Play</strong> is my blog. Frequently discussed topics include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creativity-enabling tools, especially <a href="http://computationalcreativity.net/iccc2015/proceedings/10_2Compton.pdf">casual creators</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.antoniosliapis.com/papers/mixed_initiative_co-creativity.pdf">Mixed-initiative computational creativity</a>: teaching computers to work alongside humans as <em>creative collaborators</em> and not just tools.</li>
  <li>Games, interactive storytelling, and play.</li>
  <li>UX design, UI design, and user research.</li>
  <li>Anything else that happens to be on my mind.</li>
</ul>
