<p>Hi there! I’m <strong>Max Kreminski</strong>. I’m a design researcher in the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_creativity">computational creativity</a> with a background (and ongoing interest) in game design. I frequently find myself <a href="https://mkremins.itch.io">designing games</a>; <a href="https://github.com/mkremins">programming computers</a>; <a href="/">writing words</a>; and conducting research on the subjects of human-computer interaction, creativity, and play.</p>
<p>In May 2017, I graduated from <a href="https://www.usc.edu">USC</a> with an undergraduate degree in <a href="http://catalogue.usc.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=6&poid=5163">Interactive Media & Games</a>. In September 2017, I’ll be starting a PhD in <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/departments/computational-media">Computational Media</a> at <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz</a>.</p>
