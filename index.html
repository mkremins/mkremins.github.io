		<h2 class="section-title">About</h2>
		<p>I’m a researcher in artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and creativity. I primarily design and develop AI-based <a href="/syllabi/csts-2023-01">creativity support tools</a> to assist human designers and artists, particularly in the domains of storytelling, poetry, and game design. As an interdisciplinary scholar with a background in <a href="https://www.kmjn.org/game-rankings/">technical games research</a>, I’ve also worked on a wide variety of topics related to interactive narrative and digital games.</p>
		<p>Currently, I’m a research scientist at Midjourney, where I lead the storytelling tools research lab. Before that, from 2022-2024, I was an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at Santa Clara University. I hold a Ph.D. in Computational Media from the University of California, Santa Cruz, where I was a member of the <a href="https://eis.ucsc.edu/">Expressive Intelligence Studio</a>. In the past, I’ve also been a resident at <a href="https://stochasticlabs.org/">Stochastic Labs</a>; a consultant at various game industry and tech companies; and a researcher in several labs, most notably the <a href="https://mobilemedia.usc.edu/">Mobile & Environmental Media Lab</a>, at the University of Southern California.</p>
		<p>Here’s a <a href="/publications">complete list of my papers</a> (current count: {{site.data.publications | size}}; awards and nominations: {{site.data.publications | where_exp: "pub", "pub.award" | size}}). You can also check out my <a href="/cv">full CV</a> for links to many of my talks and other output.</p>

				<span class="card-title">Patchwork</span> is a collaborative AI-supported worldbuilding canvas. Users work together to craft a coherent fictional setting and tell stories in that setting, with a multimodal AI system helping them gradually expand and refine their shared vision for the storyworld. We’re also using Patchwork as a testbed for a wide variety of novel control and steering techniques for generative AI.
